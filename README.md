# SOCIAL MEDIA DATA ANALYSIS USING PYSPARK

## OVERVIEW

As part of my internship project, I undertook the task of analyzing a large dataset of synthetic social media posts using PySpark,a powerful Python API for Apache Spark.The ojective of this task was to demonstrate the ability to process and analyze big data efficiently using scalable tools.The project involved working with a custom generated dataset of user activities including post types, likes, comments, timestamps, and device types, which reflects the structure of real world social media data.This task enabled me to explore and apply concepts of big data processing, data cleaning, aggregation, and visual analysis modern distributed computing frameworks.

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. PySPark:
   . The primary tool used for data processing was PySpark, which is the Python interface for Apache Spark.
   . PySpark was used to load the dataset,perform transformations, groupings, sorting, and to extract meaningful insights from the data.
   . Spark's ability to handle large scale data processing in memory makes it suitable for scenarios where performance and scalability are critical.

2. Google Colab:
   . The entire development and execution of the code was performed on Google Colab, a cloud based Python notebook environment.
   . Colab provides a hassle free environment with no installation required, and the flexibility to upload files and install packages like PySpark on the go.

3. CSV File Format:
   . The dataset was stored in CSV format, which is a widely used and simple structure for tabular data.
   . The dataset consisted of 100 synthetic entries with fields such as user_id, post_type, timestamp, likes, comments, device_type, and location.

4. Python
   . Python was the underlying language used to write and execute all the scripts.
   . Its compability with Spark and libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib makes it an ideal language for data science and big data analytics.

## Real World Applications of This Task:

This kind of task is highly applicable in social media analytics, marketing, and user behavior analysis.Companies such as Facebook, Instagrm, Twitter, and LinkedIn routinely deal with massive volumes of data generated by users every second.Performing scalable data analysis allows them to:

. Understand which types of content perform best
. Optimize user experience across different devices
. Detect abnormal behaviors such as bot activity or spam
. Inform targeted advertising and content strategy

Morever, this approach can be extended beyond social media to any domain dealing with big data, such as:
. E Commerce (analyzing purchases, product views)
