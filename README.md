# SOCIAL MEDIA DATA ANALYSIS USING PYSPARK

## OVERVIEW

As part of my internship project, I undertook the task of analyzing a large dataset of synthetic social media posts using PySpark,a powerful Python API for Apache Spark.The ojective of this task was to demonstrate the ability to process and analyze big data efficiently using scalable tools.The project involved working with a custom generated dataset of user activities including post types, likes, comments, timestamps, and device types, which reflects the structure of real world social media data.This task enabled me to explore and apply concepts of big data processing, data cleaning, aggregation, and visual analysis modern distributed computing frameworks.

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. PySPark:
   . The primary tool used for data processing was PySpark, which is the Python interface for Apache Spark.
   . PySpark was used to load the dataset,perform transformations, groupings, sorting, and to extract meaningful insights from the data.
   . Spark's ability to handle large scale data processing
